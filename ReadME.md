Sound artist Robert Thomas created this installation, entitled “On Your Wavelength.” In the piece, the user puts on a headset, which monitors their brainwaves. Their brainwaves then control the strength of the lights they are staring at, as well as colors and sound, too. The user can try to change their emotions (angry to distracted to focused etc) in order to watch how this plays out in the light show. The great part about this piece, and what initially drew me to it, is that it is incredibly individual and interactive. For instance, the piece visually illustrates how an emotion like “anger” can be processed completely different based on the person. People who have interacted with the piece come out with various experiences, from being incredibly scared to being upset and emotional. The ability to affect an audience on a deep, immersive level like this means the artists has created something relatively rare and special.

Memo Akten created a performance-based work called “Pattern Recognition” in collaboration with choreographer Alexander Whitley. The piece includes two dancers and a set of light beams. The lights are motion-responsive and follow the dancers in their attempt to tackle questions of learning and memory, as these relate to artificial intelligence. I love how this piece is able to merge two seemingly separate art forms, putting forth a though-provoking performance about the interplay between dance and technology. Though the piece can only be fully experienced by the dancers themselves, it has been performed many times for audiences.
